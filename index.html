            <h2> Featured Article: The Endangered Whale Shark </h2>
            <p>
            The whale shark (Rhincodon typus), the largest fish in the ocean, is an endangered species facing numerous threats. Despite their enormous size, these gentle giants are filter feeders, relying on plankton and small fish for nourishment. Their populations are declining due to habitat destruction, illegal fishing, and bycatch in commercial fisheries. Additionally, ship strikes and ocean pollution, particularly from plastic waste, pose significant dangers to their survival. Conservation efforts, including the establishment of marine protected areas and stricter fishing regulations, are critical for ensuring the long-term survival of this remarkable species.
